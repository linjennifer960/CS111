<h2>LRU is not enough</h2>
<P>
The success of LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement algorithms is the stuff
of legends.  Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring, but for most purposes our 
best guess is that the near future will be like the recent past.
Unless you have inside information (i.e. references are not random, and
you know understand the pattern) it is generally held that
there is little profit to be gained from trying to out-smart LRU.
The reason LRU works so well is that most programs exhibit
some degree of temporal and spatial locality:
<UL>
    <LI> if they use some code or data, they are likely
         to come back to access the same locations again.</LI>
    <LI> If they access code or data in a particular page,
    	 they are likely to reference other code
	 (or data) in the same vicinity.</LI>
</UL>
But these are statements about a single program or process.
If we are doing Round-Robin time-sharing with multiple processes
we give each process a brief opportunity to run, after which we 
run all the other processes before running it again.  With
the exception of shared text segments, separate processes
seldom access the same pages. 
<UL>
   <LI>	the most recently used pages in memory belong to the
   	process that will not be run for a long time.</li>
   <LI>	the least recently used pages in memory belong to
   	the process that is just about to run again.</li>
   <LI> this destroys strict temporal and spatial locality,
        as reference behavior becomes periodic (rather than continuous).</li>
</UL>
<P>
In the absence of temporal and spatial locality, Global LRU
will make poor decisions.  Global LRU and Round-Robin scheduling
are great algorithms, but they do not work well as a team.
It might make sense to give each process its own
dedicated set of page frames.  When that process needed a new
page, we would LRU replace the oldest page in that set.
This would be <em>per-process</em> LRU, and that might work 
very well with Round-Robin scheduling.
</P>
<h2>The concept of a Working Set</h2>
<P>
As we discovered in our discussion of paging:
<UL>
   <li>	We do not need to give each process as many pages 
	of physical memory as appear in the virtual address 
	space.</li>
   <li>	We do not even need to give each process as many
   	pages of its virtual address as it will ever access.</li>
</UL>
<P>
It is a good thing if a process experiences occasional page
faults, and has to replace old (no longer interesting) pages
with new ones.  What we want to avoid is page faults due
to running a process in too little memory.
We want to keep the page-faults down to a manageable rate. 
The ideal mean-time-between-page-faults
would be equal to the time-slice length.  
As we give a process fewer
and fewer page frames in which to operate, the page fault
rate rises and our performance gets worse (as we spend less
time doing useful computation and more time processing
page faults).  
</P>
<P>
The dramatic degradation in system performance associated
with not having enough memory to efficiently run all of
the ready processes is called <em>thrashing</em>.
</P>
<UL>
   <LI> If we think that we can have 25 processes in the 
   	ready queue, then we had better have enough memory
	for all 25 of those processes.</LI>
   <LI> If we only have enough memory to run 15 of those
        processes, then we should take the other 10 out 
	of the ready queue (e.g. by swapping them out).</li>
   <LI> The improved performance resulting from reducing
   	the number of page faults will more than make up
	for the delays processes experience while being
	swapped between primary and secondary storage.</li>
</UL>
<P>
There is, for any given computation, at any given time, a
number of pages such that:
<UL>
   <li> if we increase the number of page frames allocated
        to that process, it makes very little difference
	in the performance.</li>
   <li> if we reduce the number of page frames allocated
        to that process, the performance suffers noticeably.</li>
</UL>
We will call that number the process' <em>working set size</em>
(at that particular time).
</p>

<h2>How large is a working set</h2>
<P>
Different computations require different amounts of memory.
A tight loop operating on a few variables might need only two
pages.  Complex combinations of functions applied to large
amounts of data could require hundreds of thousands of pages.
Not only are different programs likely to require different
amounts of memory, a single program may require different
amounts of memory at different points during its execution.
</P>
<P>
Requiring more memory is not necessarily a bad thing ... it merely
reflects the costs of that particular computation.  When we explored
scheduling we saw that different processes have different degrees
of interactivity, and that if we could characterize the interactivity
of each process we could more efficiently schedule it.  The same is 
true of working set size.
We can infer a process' working set size by observing its behavior.  
If a process is experiencing many page faults, its working set
is larger than the memory currently allocated to it.
If a process is not experiencing page faults, it may have
too much memory allocated to it.
If we can allocate the right amount of memory to each process,
we will minimize our page faults (overhead) and maximize our 
throughput (efficiency).
</P>
<h2>Implementing Working Set replacement</h2>
<P>
Regularly scanning all of memory to identify the least recently used
page is a very expensive process.  With global LRU, we saw that a 
clock-like scan was a very inexpensive way to achieve a very 
similar affect.  The clock hand position was a surrogate for age:
</P>
<ul>
   <li>the most recently examined pages are immediately behind the hand.</li>
   <li>the pages we examined longest ago are immediately in front of the hand.</li>
   <li>if the page immediately in front of the hand has not be referenced since
       the last time it has been scaned, it must be very old ... even if it
       is not actually the oldest page in memory.</li>
</ul>
<P>
We can use a very similar approach to implement working sets. 
But we will need to maintain a little bit more information:
<UL>
   <li> each page frame is associated with an <em>owning process</em></li>
   <li> each process has an <em>accumulated CPU time</em></li>
   <li> each page frame will have a <em>last referenced</em> time,
        value, taken from the <em>accumulated CPU</em> timer of 
	its <em>owning process</em>.
   <li> we maintain a <em>target age</em> parameter ... which 
        is <em>keep in memory</em> goal for all pages.</li>
</UL>
The new scan algorithm will be:
</p>
<pre><code>
	while ...
	{
		// see if this page is old enough to replace
		owningProc = page->owner;
		if (page.referenced) {
			// assume it was just referenced
			page.lastRef = owningProc->accumulatedTime;
			page.referenced = 0;
		} else {
			// has it gone unreferenced long enough?
			age = owningProc->accumulatedTime - page.lastRef;
			if (age > targetAge)
				return(page);
		}
	}
</code></pre>
<P>
The key elements of this algorithm are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li> Age decisions are not made on the basis of clock time, but
        accumulated CPU time in the owning process.  Pages only age
	when their owner runs without referencing them.</li>
   <li> If we find a page that has been referenced since the last scan,
        we assume it was just referenced.</li>
   <li> If a page is younger than the target age, we do not want to replace
        it ... since recycling of young pages indicates we may be thrashing.</li>
   <li> If a page is older than the target age, we take it away from its
        current owner, and give it to a new (needy) process.</li>
   <li> If there are no pages older than the target age, we 
        probably have too many processes to fit in the available
	memory, and we need to start swapping some of them out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dynamic Equilibrium to the rescue</h2>
<P>
This is often referred to as a <em>page stealing</em> algorithm, because
a process that needs another page <em>steals</em> it from a process that
does not seem to need it as much.
<ul>
   <li> Every process is continuously losing pages that it has not
        recently refrenced.</li>
   <li> Every process is continuously stealing pages from other processes.</li>
   <li> Processes that reference more pages more often, will accumulate
        larger working sets.</li> 
   <li> Processes that reference fewer pages less often will find their
        working sets reduced.</li>
   <li> When programs change their behavior, their allocated working sets
        adjust promptly and automatically.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
This is a dynamic equilibrium mechanism.  
The continuously opposing processes of stealing and being stolen from
will automatically allocate the available memory to the running processes
in proportion to their working set sizes.  It does not try to manage 
processes to any pre-configured notion of a reasonable working set size.
Rather it manages memory to minimize the number of page faults, and 
to avoid thrashing.
