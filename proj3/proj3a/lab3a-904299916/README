Included files:
	 lab3a.c: program that analyzes image files and outputs six csv files that
	 	  describes super block, cylinder groups, free-lists, inodes, indirect
		  blocs, and directories
	 Makefile: includes make, make clean, and make dist to build the program,
	 	   remove files generated from make, create tarball respectively
	 README: this file


Testing methodology:
	I used the given disk-image file to test my program, and then I used the diff
	command to compare my generated csv files and the given sample csv files. If
	the diff command doesn't output anything, this means that the csv files are
	identical and that the program is correct.
	
Limitations and Problems:
	5 parts of my program should be correct because the csv files are identical,
	however for the directory part, some of the output are missing. There used to be
	an infinite loop, and this problem was solved after I added sanity checking.
	However, some output are still missing.
